# Analyzation-and-Simulation-of-Robotic-arm-in-Matlab-and-Vrep
Designed a robotic arm with RRRPRR configuration (6 degrees of freedom) and simulated using custom designed forward and inverse kinematic algorithms.Created an industrial office type environment in Vrep and had simulated a UR-5 robotic arm for pick and place operation using Peter Corke robotics toolbox in Matlab.
